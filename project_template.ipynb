    "**Research Question**  \n",
    "What factors drive airport delays across the top 10 European airports in 2023-24, and can we build predictive models to identify possible delays for a flight using the information available?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub Questions**\n",
    "- What type of delays are occurring most at the airports?\n",
    "- Which airports experience the highest, the lowest delay, and most consistent delay rates?\n",
    "- How do delays relate to traffic volume and efficiency?\n",
    "- How do delays distribute geographically across Europe, and which airports stand out as persistent “delay hotspots”?\n",
    "- Which features (traffic levels, weekday/weekend, month, etc.) are the strongest predictors of high-delay days?\n",
    "- What model can predict the chance of delay and the amount delay for a flight?"
